### :pushpin: Context

As a requirement of the **DHIS2** technical assessment instructions, the library used in this project was React using the Next.js framework. Currently, the React's team recommends choosing one of the frameworks popular in the community:

> If you want to build a new app or a new website fully with React, we recommend picking one of the React-powered frameworks popular in the community. Frameworks provide features that most apps and sites eventually need, including routing, data fetching, and generating HTML.

**Major assumptions or design choices**

1) I've used TypeScript because you can save time by avoiding bugs due to typos and other errors, it offers faster performance and the IntelliSense works better, generating a superior developer experience.

2) I've chosen the Radix UI because its optimization related to accessibility.

3) About the usage of the Tanstack React Query, the reason is because I think it makes fetching and caching easier to manage and improve the performance of data response, improving the user experience.

4) About the requirement *"Ability to 'star' a dashboard and persist the starred states on reload"*, I've used the `localStorage` to persist the changes. In a real application that has this functionality, it would be better if it could be saved by using the API.

5) I've created a *hook* called `useDashaboards` using the *Context API* to avoid *prop drilling*, organize and centralize data and functions.

6) Tailwind CSS was chosen because with it, we can use pre-built CSS classes for styling, which saves time and effort of writing custom CSS from scratch.

7) And finally, for the application deploy, I've picked the Vercel platform because I find it simple to use and also they are able to generate a preview version of the app for each commit done.

> [!NOTE]
> I tried to use the **DHIS2 UI Library** to develop the components, but I had issues to deploy the solution, so I redid the components using HTML elements with Tailwind CSS and other librarys.
